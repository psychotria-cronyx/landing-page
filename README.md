Project 1 (Landing Page) | The Odin Project

This project took some time to make responsive. 
Things i learnt in this project: is to outline the boxes in your website structure. Have a hard think about how its going to look on multiple viewports.
Start styling from one screensize - then scale up or down. Don't keep going back and forth between vw before you have finished one look. This confuses things in the media queries. 
Another lesson is pondering when to use flex vs grid vs display.
Skills to improve on are: time management, responsive fonts, considering "templates / snippets" vs brute forcing the whole webpage solo. Don't reinvent the wheel...
